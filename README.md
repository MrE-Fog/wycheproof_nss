NSS format. Source files need to be specified in the script. Results are 
currently just printed to the console and can be copied from there.

target/ contains successfully converted test vectors.

doc.txt contains a documentation of the available wycheproof test vectors, 
which of them are relevant for NSS and a rough description of what needs
to be done to implement each type of test vector for the NSS CI.
